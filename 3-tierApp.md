A **three-tier application** refers to a **software architecture pattern** that separates the application into **three distinct logical layers**, each with its own responsibility. This model enhances scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.

### ðŸ”§ The Three Tiers:

1. ### **Presentation Tier (Client Layer)**

   * **What it does**: Handles user interaction and displays data.
   * **Examples**: Web browser (HTML/CSS/JS), mobile app UI, React/Angular frontend.
   * **Function**: Sends user input to the application tier and displays results to the user.

2. ### **Application Tier (Business Logic Layer)**

   * **What it does**: Contains the core logic of the application â€” processes data, makes decisions, and enforces rules.
   * **Examples**: Java (Spring Boot), .NET Core, Node.js, Python Flask/Django.
   * **Function**: Acts as a mediator between the user interface and the data tier.

3. ### **Data Tier (Database Layer)**

   * **What it does**: Stores, retrieves, and manages data.
   * **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle.
   * **Function**: Executes queries and persists data.

### ðŸ§± How It Looks (Simplified Diagram):

```
[Presentation Tier] <--> [Application Tier] <--> [Data Tier]
   (Browser/UI)           (Backend/Server)         (Database)
```

### âœ… Benefits of Three-Tier Architecture:

* **Modularity**: Each tier can be developed and scaled independently.
* **Maintainability**: Easier to update or replace one layer without affecting the others.
* **Security**: Direct access to the database is restricted to the application tier.
* **Reusability**: Backend APIs can serve multiple frontends (web, mobile, etc.).

### ðŸ”„ Real-World Example:

In your international money transfer app:

* **Presentation Tier**: React/React Native UI
* **Application Tier**: Spring Boot backend with REST APIs
* **Data Tier**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB to store users, transactions, etc.
